📌 Project Objectives
This project focuses on performing penetration testing in a controlled lab environment to simulate real-world cyber attacks used by malicious hackers. The goal is to:

Identify vulnerabilities

Exploit security flaws ethically

Understand and implement remediation techniques

It uses Kali Linux as the attacker platform and Metasploitable as the vulnerable system. Various stages of ethical hacking are covered including:

Reconnaissance

Scanning

Enumeration

Exploitation

Privilege Escalation

Remediation

📖 Theory About the Project
Network Penetration Testing is the process of evaluating a system's security by simulating attacks from both external and internal threats.

🔍 Key Phases:
Reconnaissance: Gathering information about the target.

(Other phases like scanning, enumeration, etc., can be expanded here if needed)

🛠️ Technologies Used
Operating System: Kali Linux

Vulnerable Target: Metasploitable

Tools Used: Nmap, Metasploit Framework, Burp Suite, etc.

Languages/Commands: Bash, Linux Command Line

🎯 Learning Outcomes
Gained hands-on experience in ethical hacking techniques.

Understood real-world exploit tactics and defensive strategies.

Developed skills in vulnerability identification and remediation.
